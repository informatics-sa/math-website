title: Editor pages guide

## Idea
You have an easy UI to add/edit/delete data.

After you finish, you go to the needed page and paste the new version, without need of direct edit on JSON.

The pages:
- [Exams editor](/editor/exams.html)
- [Participations editor](/editor/participations.html)
- [People editor](/editor/people.html)
